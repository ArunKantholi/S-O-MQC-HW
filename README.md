# Solutions for Modern Quantum Chemistry, Szabo & Ostlund

Compiled with XeLaTeX. TeXLive 2020-latest is recommended.

## Note
Since v1.2, we move the pdf to releases to reduce the size of the repo, which is auto-compiled by GitHub Actions. But the compilation may still have problems. If you find the released pdf is wrong, plase check the old v1.1 branch, which still keep pdf files, to confirm and report the bug.
