# Solutions for Modern Quantum Chemistry, Szabo & Ostlund

Compiled with XeLaTeX. TeXLive 2020-latest is recommended.

## Note
Since v1.2, we move the pdf to [releases](https://github.com/hebrewsnabla/S-O-MQC-HW/releases) to reduce the size of the repo, which is auto-compiled by GitHub Actions. The released pdf can be downloaded at `SzaboSolutions-v*.tar.gz` in each release.

But the compilation may still have problems. You can check the old `v1.1` branch to view the old pdf files. If you find the released pdf is wrong, please report the bug.
